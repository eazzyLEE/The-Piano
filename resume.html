If the JavaScript is loaded first and it is supposed to affect the HTML below it, it might not work, as the JavaScript would be loaded before the HTML it is supposed to work on. Therefore, putting JavaScript near the bottom of the HTML page is often the best strategy."

So, you can imagine if you have plenty of <script> tags in the head, calling on multiple external scripts will block the HTML from loading, thus greeting the user with a blank white screen, because no other content on your page will load until the JS files have completely loaded."

77   jQuery is a common JavaScript library for reading and making changes to the 
78   Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree that contains information 
79   about what is actually visible on a website. 
80  
81   While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the 
82   DOM and the DOM can change. In fact, JavaScript's power comes from 
83   its ability to manipulate the DOM, which is essentially a JavaScript 
84   object. When JavaScript makes something interesting happen on a 
85   website, it's likely the action happened because JavaScript changed 
86   the DOM. jQuery is fast and easy to use, but it doesn't do anything 
87   you can't accomplish with vanilla (regular) JavaScript.

95   The next line tells the browser where to download the JavaScript file you'll be

103   These scripts are written in JavaScript. You'll be breaking them down as part of 
104   a quiz. Essentially, the next few lines are checking to see if you have not 
105   changed each section of the resume. If you have not made any changes to a section 
106   of the resume, then that part of the resume does not show up. More on this in the
