				<h2 class="my-text-light-grey">About Me</h2>
				<hr style="width:200px" class="my-opacity">
				<p>I am a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate of the University of Ibadan applying for the Andela Fellowship program (cycle XXVI). My internship at AirFirst-Nigeria and a management role at an academic institution, amongst others, gave me the opportunity to interact with people at various levels and in different specializations. Necessary application of human relations, continuous willingness to learn and application of analytical reasoning, I believe, makes me competent for this opportunity.
During my attachment at AirFirst Nigeria Limited (an aircraft maintenance company), I worked with the Quality control department, the project planning/Technical records department and the Maintenance and Engineering department as we serviced and maintained private aircrafts, carried out maintenance checks and periodic inspections. I liaised with Pilots, maintenance engineers and technicians. The consistent need for accuracy and hundred percent solutions to such demands, considering the peculiarity of the industry, practically developed my dexterity, decision making and total commitment to tasks brought my way.
Andelaâ€™s regard for skill development is fascinating. Its interest in helping its employees to fully understand the role technology plays in our economy, and its major emphasis on teamwork, including collaboration irrespective of location, is something I would love to partake in. I intend to apply the programming skills I am taught to mechanical engineering, this will enable me discover more solutions to everyday-engineering-demands and transcend limitations that come with such issues.
I am excited at the prospect of working with Andela. Thank you for your consideration. You can reach me on the contact addresses listed above for further inquiries.</p>
